#Free Saint Survey

This is a minimum viable prototype for the survey funnel, health provider review portal and recipe swap. The objective of the survey funnel is as follows:

    -The user can input their health survey questionnaire into the Free Saint database and later they will get an auto generated reported called Metabolism Maximer  
    -The user can add and review new health providers
    -The user can add and enjoy healthy recipes

As this prototype develops, it will iterate with user journey stories and client interviews. The goal of this app in the next 12-months include: 

    -Building a machine learning algorithm that "learns" how to best optimize an algorithm that I will build called the Metabolism Maximizer
    -The science behind the recently discovered stomach hormone called Ghrelin and Leptin and the research momentum to find a way to manipulate Ghrelin-blockers to treat obesity
    -Partnership with a well-known endocronoligist for new approaches to lipolysis (fat burning)

This game has the following rules in play:
    -Dealer hits until their cards total 17 or more points;
    -Dealer never splits or doubles down;
    -Dealer pays 3:2 for a player blackjack;
    -A black jack (first two cards totalling 21) beats any hand including 21;
    -Other non-blackjack hands with a tied score result in a "push" and the player gets their original bet back, including 2 simultaneous blackjacks.
