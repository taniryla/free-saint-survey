# Free Saint Survey

Free Saint is a health tech company focused on creating the "uber" scheduling app for health-related soulpreneuers. This minimum viable prototype includes a survey funnel, health provider review portal and recipe swap. The objective of the survey funnel is as follows:

    -The user can input their health survey questionnaire into the Free Saint database and later they will get an auto generated reported called Metabolism Maximer  
    -The user can add and review new health providers
    -The user can add and enjoy healthy recipes

As this prototype develops, it will iterate with user journey stories and client interviews. The goal of this app in the next 12-months include: 

    -Building a machine learning algorithm that "learns" how to best optimize an algorithm that I will build called the Metabolism Maximizer
    -The science behind the recently discovered stomach hormone called Ghrelin and Leptin and the research momentum to find a way to manipulate Ghrelin-blockers to     treat obesity
    -GHS (growth hormone secretagogues) such as MK-677 Ibutamoren Mesylate have been reported by NIH to mimic the gastric peptide hormone Grhelin as an approach to     increase metabolism, act as a samatoastation antagonists to reduce cortisol, and enhace the activity of growth hormones
    -Partnership with a well-known endocronoligist for new approaches to lipolysis (fat burning)

# Three Year Plan

The challenges in developing this product:

    -I had to plan three years ahead to know where to start prior to client interviews to guide the iteration of this project
    -The health provider was identified as one of the first primary features because our marketing team will be able to SEO-optimize and rank in the top ten for        target health providers
    -The healthy recipe was identified as the other core feature because we're already doing Instagram marketing and getting traction from niche recipe swap            strategies
    -Due to the complexity of the development, I spent a lot of time on the Figma Wireframes, the ERD (entity relationship diagram), and the three year vision

# Next Steps

Planned future enhancements include:

    -Branded user design
    -Client iterations
    -AI algorithms that "learns" optimal strategies for diet plans (and what diets an individual should follow), behavior and emotional guidance, and data-based        daily intake strategies
    -iPhone and Android app
    -an ecommerce shopping engine
    -API integrations with health-related data resources
    -a marketing ecosystem built in Salesforces Apex language for health coaches, personal trainers, nutritionists, endocrinologists, embodiment coaches,   
    accupunturists and sleep experts
    -Saas for global fungible value chain including "first" and "last" mile logistics, fulfillment and order management for health-related soulpreneuers
